# Nelpy 

This repository contains different modules for performing Natural language processing(NLP) tasks in Python.

Following is the gist of each one of them. Check out individual `README.md`s for more.

### Information Extraction

In this module, following functionalities are present.

1. Dependency Parsing : The input is a sentence and the output is a dependency parsed graph. Stanford Parser is used along with NLTK for the same.

2. N-gram Discovery : Identifying n-grams that are sensible from a sentence (like 'Computer Scientist' or 'Great Britain'), using a POS tag pattern matching.
